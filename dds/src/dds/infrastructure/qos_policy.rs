/// It provides the basic mechanism for an application to specify quality of service parameters. It has an attribute name that is used
/// to identify uniquely each QoS policy. All concrete QosPolicy classes derive from this root and include a value whose type
/// depends on the concrete QoS policy.
/// The type of a QosPolicy value may be atomic, such as an integer or float, or compound (a structure). Compound types are used
/// whenever multiple parameters must be set coherently to define a consistent value for a QosPolicy.
/// Each Entity can be configured with a list of QosPolicy. However, any Entity cannot support any QosPolicy. For instance, a
/// DomainParticipant supports different QosPolicy than a Topic or a Publisher.
/// QosPolicy can be set when the Entity is created, or modified with the set_qos method. Each QosPolicy in the list is treated
/// independently from the others. This approach has the advantage of being very extensible. However, there may be cases where
/// several policies are in conflict. Consistency checking is performed each time the policies are modified via the set_qos
/// operation.
/// When a policy is changed after being set to a given value, it is not required that the new value be applied instantaneously; the
/// Service is allowed to apply it after a transition phase. In addition, some QosPolicy have “immutable” semantics meaning that
/// they can only be specified either at Entity creation time or else prior to calling the enable operation on the Entity.
