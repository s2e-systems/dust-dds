//! The traits necessary to make a type capable of being published and subscribed by the DDS middleware.
//!
//! To be able to publish and subscribe the information contained in a type using DustDDS,
//! this type has to implement the following traits [`DdsHasKey`], [`CdrSerialize`], [`DdsDeserialize`],
//! [`DdsSerializeKey`], [`DdsGetKeyFromFoo`], [`DdsGetKeyFromSerializedData`] and
//! [`DdsGetKeyFromSerializedKeyFields`]. Depending on the used functionality only a subset
//! of these traits might need to be implemented.
//!
//! While implementing the traits above is the most flexible way to have a type supported by
//! DustDDS it is the most common use case that a type must be transmitted using the format
//! defined by RTPS to ensure interoperability between different implementations.
//! For this common scenario DustDDS provides a set of traits which are simpler to implement
//! and which provide blanket implementations for the traits above. These are
//! [`DdsBorrowKeyHolder`] and [`DdsOwningKeyHolder`] in combination with
//! [`serde::Serialize`] and [`serde::Deserialize`].
//!
//! For the large majority of cases the simpler subset of traits can be automatically derived
//! using the provided procedural macro [`DdsType`]. Each of these traits can also be individually
//! derived using the respective proc macro.

/// any field is marked `#[key]` or not.
///
/// An example of a typical usage of derive is the following:
///
/// ```rust
///     use dust_dds::topic_definition::type_support::DdsType;
///
///     #[derive(DdsType)]
///     struct KeyedData {
///         #[key]
///         id: u8,
///         value: u32,
///     }
/// ```
///
/// It is also possible to derive structs with a lifetime:
///
/// ```rust
///     use dust_dds::topic_definition::type_support::DdsType;
///     use std::borrow::Cow;
///
///     #[derive(DdsType)]
///     struct BorrowedData<'a> {
///         #[key]
///         id: u8,
///         value: Cow<'a, [u8]>,
